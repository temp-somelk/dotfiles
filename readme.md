Backup to set up an encrypted Arch on a [USB drive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_Arch_Linux_on_a_removable_medium#Tips) (bootable on both BIOS and UEFI preferably). Quick checklist to set it up fast, in case I forget the password again and have to reinstall arch. Still [to-do](#todos). PS. If someone else is reading this, **please refer to the official ArchWiki.** As you might have noticed most of these are outlinks to the wiki anyways. It's for a reason.

## Base Installation
1. [Setting up gpt table and partitioning disk](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPT_fdisk#Create_a_partition_table_and_partitions) with [this layout](#disk-layout)

2. [Setting up LUKS Container, Logical Volumes](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS)

2b.1 [Setting LUKS Container on BTRFS filesystem](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Btrfs_subvolumes_with_swap)

2b.2 Make a ```btrfs``` filesystem on cryptdevice using ``` mkfs.btrfs -L "label" --csum xxhash /dev/device```. [Possible checksum algorithms](https://man.archlinux.org/man/btrfs.5#CHECKSUM_ALGORITHMS)

2b.3 btrfs mount options include ```noatime,compress-force=zstd:1,datacow,datasum,nodiscard, space_cache=v2,ssd```. Use ```zstd:1``` in case it is an NVME drive, ```zstd:2``` for a SATA SSD, and ```zstd:*(default)*``` for HDDs, since CPU calculation for compression can be a bottleneck. ```noatime``` cane be reverted back to ```relatime``` in case apps mishave and need to know access times. ```sdd``` in case you are using an SSD.

2b.4 Create btrfs subvolumes by first mounting the cryptdevice and then running ``` btrfs subvolume create /mountpoint/{@,@home,@snapshots,@var}```.

2b.5 Unmount the *cryptdevice* and then remount the *subvolumes* using mount options  ```mount -o noatime,compress-force=zstd:1,datacow,datasum,nodiscard,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@ /dev/mapper/cryptdevice /mountpoint/``` and the same for ```subvol={@home,snapshots,var}``` to be mounted at ```{/mountpoint/home,/mountpoint/snapshots,/mountpoint/var}```. Make sure the mount options persist in the generated fstab of new installation media.

3. [Backing up and restoring LUKS Header](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Backup_and_restore)

4. [Installing base Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Installation) with [these packages](#packages)

5. For initramfs hooks,<sup>[1](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_Arch_Linux_on_a_removable_medium#Installation_tweaks) [2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Configuring_mkinitcpio_2)</sup> <br />
```HOOKS=(base udev block keyboard keymap autodetect consolefont modconf encrypt lvm2 filesystems fsck)```<br />
```HOOKS=(base systemd autodetect keyboard sd-vconsole modconf block sd-encrypt sd-lvm2 filesystems fsck)```<br />
*(Don't forget to rebuild initramfs)*

6. To install GRUB for both systems, <sup>[1](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB#Installation) [2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB#Installation_2) [3](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_Arch_Linux_on_a_removable_medium#GRUB)</sup> <br />
```# grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdx --recheck```<br />
```# grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB  --removable --recheck```

7. For GRUB config, add the [cryptdevice parameters](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Configuring_the_boot_loader_2) under ```GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""``` and [disable submenu](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB/Tips_and_tricks#Disable_submenu), both in ```etc/default/grub``` and regenerate /boot/grub/grub.cfg

8. Add user ```# useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/zsh koala``` and add wheel to sudoers ```# EDITOR=nano visudo```

9. ```# passwd``` and ```# passwd koala```

## System
1. ~~To lock tty session after inactivity, make ```lock.sh``` in ```/etc/profile.d/``` and add ```TMOUT=300``` and on next line, add ```trap '[[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && physlock -p $USER' SIGALRM```~~ **This is more headache than necessary, don't do it. Just run ```vlock``` before leaving your pc**

2. keyring

3. password mananger

4. For networking, use [NetworkManager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager), by enabling NetworkManager.service and [disabling dhcpcd/netctl/other services](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Additional_interfaces)

5. openvPN or WireGuard - https://sylvaindurand.org/setting-up-a-vpn-with-wireguard/

6. nftables - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nftables

7. power management

8. ntp

9. Update mirrorlists with ```reflector```, and enable ```reflector.service``` & ```reflector.timer```, and set ```/etc/xdg/reflector/reflector.conf```:
```
    --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
    --connection-timeout 5
    --download-timeout 5
    --protocol https
    --completion-percent 100.0
    --country de,fr,ch,nl,no,fi,be,at
    --age 2
    --score 20
    --sort rate
```

## Zsh
1. [Autologin](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/getty#Automatic_login_to_virtual_console) and use ```Type=simple``` in ```/etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty\@tty1.service```

2. In ```~/.zshrc``` source files for ```zsh-syntax-highlighting``` ```zsh-autosuggestions``` ```zsh-history-substring-search``` ```zsh-theme-powerlevel10k``` in this exact order. \
```zsh-history-substring-search``` arch package is outdated and does not support "HISTORY_SUBSTRING_SEARCH_PREFIXED=1". Manually download download the [.zsh file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search/master/zsh-history-substring-search.plugin.zsh) and optionally move it ```/usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-history-substring-search```to and source it.

3. Make ```~/.zprofile``` and add [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sway#Autostart_on_login) to autostart sway, remove ```exec``` to keep logged in after exiting sway

### Sway & Wayland
1. Copy all the configs to  ```~/```, ```~/.config``` and other respective directories

2. To open firefox [in wayland mode](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/firefox#Wayland), set environment variable ```MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1``` in ```.zshenv```

3. Export ```XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland``` and ```XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=sway``` to ```.zshenv```

4. ```LIBSEAT_BACKEND=logind``` in ```.zshenv``` in case libseat fails to connect to socket

5. In case hardware acceleration doesn't work out of the box, [set environment variables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration#Configuration), ```LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=i965/iHD/radeonsi/nouveau``` and ```VDPAU_DRIVER=va_gl/radeonsi/nouveau```.

6. ```MOZ_WEBRENDER=1``` in case there are performance issues (and/or CPU is not properly utilized/optimized), and ```MOZ_ACCELERATED=1``` in order to force hardware acceleration for MOZ_WEBRENDER to work in case it is disabled by default

### Extras
1. Add ```userChrome.css``` in ```~/.mozilla/firefox/(the_deafult_active_profile)/chrome/```

2. [Enable stylesheets for firefox](https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html#aboutconfig) by enabling ```toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets``` in ```about:config```

3. Install the [firefox theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/an-even-better-lime-green/) you made

4. Set ```cmus``` theme using ```:colorscheme```

5. Uncomment ```VerbosePkgLists```, ```CheckSpace```, ```Color``` and ```ParallelDownloads = 6``` in ```/etc/pacman.conf```

6. Set ```EDITOR=nvim```, ```TERMINAL=termite``` and ```BROWSER=firefox``` in ```/etc/environment```

7. In case of SSD that supports [trim](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive#TRIM), enable ```fstrim.service```(?) and ```fstrim.timer```. In case the drive is NVME, install ```nvme-cli```, for userspace support.

### Environment Variable
The ```.zshenv``` file should end up looking like
```
EDITOR=nvim
XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland      
XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=sway
LIBSEAT_BACKEND=logind
TERMINAL=foot
BROWSER=firefox
MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
MOZ_WEBRENDER=1
MOZ_ACCELERATED=1
```

* In case of a BTRFS filesystem on ```/```, there is no need for an LVM, and the entire cryptdevice can be formatted as a BTRFS filesystem. The separation between ```/``` and ```/home``` can be done using subvolumes, and a swapfile can be used instead of a swap partition.

* In case of a UEFI system (with or without GRUB), there is no need for a BIOS GRUB partition.

### For Permanent Install (on PC)
* Windows readable partition/Windows partition need not be the first partition
* Partition and format boot partition according to need (Either just for BIOS or just for UEFI)
* Enable journaling (use defaults) for ext4 partitions
* Install GRUB for either just BIOS or UEFI, (or just use systemd-boot in case it's UEFI)
* Use [default](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Configuring_mkinitcpio_2) encrypt mkinitcpio hooks (Don't move ```blocks``` hook)
* Add a non-admin account ```# useradd -m guest``` and ```passwd guest```


Enable trim on the dm-crypt with :allow-discards after cryptdevice boot paramater see ahead efibootmgr command.
